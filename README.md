# Thrive take home challenge

- The ruby version I used (3.1.2) is just the one that came by default on the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Debian instance.
- All work was done in a TDD fashion; write a unit test, see it fail. Write the minimum amount of code to see it pass. Refactor. (Red Green Refactor)
- I left all refactoring as the very last thing, once the full test suite was there. The initial "final" solution just has all the code running in a single file with no classes at all, just some simple Struct with all logic just running with no methods.
- All work done can be seen in the commit history.
