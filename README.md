# Thrive take home challenge

- The ruby version I used (3.1.2) is just the one that came by default on the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Debian instance.
- All work was done in a TDD fashion; write a unit test, see it fail. Write the minimum amount of code to see it pass. Refactor. (Red Green Refactor)
- I left all refactoring as the very last thing, once the full test suite was there. The initial "final" solution just has all the code running in a single file with some methods, no real classes, just Structs.
- All work done can be seen in the commit history.

## Caveats

- You will see 2 contributors here. That is because I used both my emails. My live account email was used for an existing GitHub account, but I have not used that account in years. For consistency I will use only my gmail for most of the commits.
